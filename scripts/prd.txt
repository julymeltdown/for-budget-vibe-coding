# Integrated Automation Solution Enhancement PRD

## Project Overview
The Integrated Automation Solution is an AI-driven development automation system that uses Claude Desktop GUI automation to generate code, run tests, and manage development tasks. This PRD outlines enhancements to integrate Task Master capabilities and improve the system.

## Current System Capabilities
- Claude Desktop GUI automation for code generation
- Task-based development workflow
- Automatic test execution and failure correction
- Code quality analysis (mock detection, commented code)
- Git integration for automatic commits
- Notification system (Slack/Telegram)
- Support for multiple project types (Gradle, Maven, Go, Python)

## Enhancement Goals
1. **Task Master Integration**: Leverage Task Master's MCP protocol for direct AI communication
2. **Progress Memory System**: Implement persistent memory for tracking task/subtask progress
3. **Hybrid Automation**: Support both GUI automation and MCP-based automation
4. **Enhanced Task Management**: Import Task Master's advanced task management features
5. **Real-time Progress Tracking**: Implement live progress monitoring and reporting

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Task Master MCP Integration
- Add MCP client capabilities to communicate with Task Master
- Create adapter layer to translate between current task format and Task Master format
- Implement fallback mechanism (use GUI automation if MCP fails)
- Support for research-backed task generation using Task Master

### 2. Progress Memory System
- Design persistent storage for task progress tracking
- Track current task ID, subtask ID, and completion status
- Implement checkpoint system for resuming interrupted work
- Create progress visualization dashboard
- Store execution history and metrics

### 3. Hybrid Automation Mode
- Detect if Task Master MCP is available
- Automatically switch between MCP and GUI automation
- Implement configuration for preferred automation method
- Create unified interface for both automation types

### 4. Enhanced Task Management Features
- Import Task Master's task complexity analysis
- Implement task expansion capabilities
- Add dependency management between tasks
- Support for moving and reorganizing tasks
- Enable subtask generation based on complexity

### 5. Real-time Progress Dashboard
- Create web-based dashboard for monitoring progress
- Display current task/subtask being executed
- Show test results and failure history
- Integrate with notification system for alerts
- Provide execution timeline and statistics

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Task Master MCP Client
- Implement MCP client library
- Create Task Master service wrapper
- Add configuration for MCP connection
- Test basic communication with Task Master

### Phase 2: Progress Memory System
- Design database schema for progress tracking
- Implement SQLite-based storage
- Create progress tracking API
- Add checkpoint and recovery mechanisms

### Phase 3: Hybrid Automation
- Create automation strategy interface
- Implement MCP automation strategy
- Update existing GUI automation as strategy
- Add automatic strategy selection logic

### Phase 4: Task Management Enhancement
- Port Task Master's task management features
- Create task format converters
- Implement advanced task operations
- Add task complexity analysis

### Phase 5: Progress Dashboard
- Design dashboard UI using Flask/React
- Implement real-time WebSocket updates
- Create progress visualization components
- Add historical analysis features

## Success Criteria
1. System can operate in both GUI and MCP automation modes
2. Task progress is persistently tracked and resumable
3. Dashboard provides real-time visibility into automation progress
4. Task Master's advanced features are successfully integrated
5. System maintains backward compatibility with existing task format

## Technical Stack
- Python 3.11+ (existing)
- Task Master MCP client
- SQLite for progress storage
- Flask for dashboard backend
- React for dashboard frontend
- WebSocket for real-time updates

## Non-functional Requirements
- Maintain existing notification system compatibility
- Ensure minimal performance overhead from new features
- Provide comprehensive logging for debugging
- Support concurrent task execution where possible
- Implement proper error handling and recovery

## Future Considerations
- Multi-agent collaboration support
- Cloud-based execution environment
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Machine learning for task optimization
- Natural language task definition
